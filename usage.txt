usage:
	./image device <device> [Options...]
		Image a device connected. Example: `./image direct sda [Options...]`
	./image file <device> [Options...]
		Produce an image file instead. Example: `./image file image.img [Options...]`
	./image help
		Print this help page

Options:
	--hostname=<name>
		Provide a hostname. Default is "GentooVF2"
	--timezone=<zone>
		Provide a timezone. Default is "Europe/Brussels"
	--useclang
		Image a clang-based version of gentoo
	--skipclean
		Don't unmount and remove the working directory at the end
	--scope=<scope>
		Choose the scope of the image. Default value: `BASIC`
	--mesa=<backend>
		Specify the backend to use for graphics. Default value: `NONE`

Scopes:
	MINIMAL
		The most minimal setup possible. Only has root account
	BASIC

Mesa Backends:
	NONE
		Do not build mesa
	X
		Add `X` to useflags and build mesa
	WAYLAND
		Add `wayland` to useflags and build mesa


Examples:
	`./image device sda --hostname="MyVisionfive2" --timezone="Europe/Zurich" --scope=MINIMAL`
		This will create a minimal system on /dev/sda with the hostname "MyVisionfive2" and the timezone of Zurich
	`./image file clang-based.img --useclang
		This will create an image called `clang-based.img` using clang as its compiler

Build info (As tested on my VF2 8G):
	BASIC without clang (tested on 2023-11-29):
		Build Time: 8h
		Image size: 3.1GB
